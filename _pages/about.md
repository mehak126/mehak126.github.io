Hi there!
I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof. Yao Qin](https://yaoqin1.github.io/). 

My research centers on **trustworthy, reliable, and accessible AI systems**, with a focus on **real-world healthcare applications**. 
My current projects include improving the **confidence calibration of large language models**, analysing their **multilingual performance and cross-lingual generalization in post-training**, and developing data- and AI- driven methods to improve **automated insulin delivery systems for individuals with Type 1 diabetes**.
 
Prior to this, I completed an MS in Computer Science at UC San Diego, working with <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/">Prof. Julian McAuley</a> on data-efficient recommendation systems, and a B.Tech. in Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Delhi, where I worked with <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/">Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth</a> on fairness in content recommendation. I also spent time as a software engineer in Samsung R&D’s On-Device AI team.
